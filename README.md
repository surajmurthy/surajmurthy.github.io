Welcome to my homepage.

I currently am a research scientist at Intel Labs, Bangalore. My work revolves around computer vision and computational photography.

I obtained my PhD from Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore and was advised by Prof K R Ramakrishnan who is one of the earliest people in India to work on digital image processing. My PhD thesis revolved around processing RGB-Depth images and videos for applications relevant to 3DTV and Free Viewpoint TV.

Prior to joining Intel Labs, I was a Technical Architect in the Camera Algorithms team, ADAS unit at Continental Automotive, a leading ADAS solutions provider for OEMs. My work revolved around efficient camera calibration techniques for ADAS systems.

Broadly, my research interests span across computer vision, computational photography and machine learning. More specifically, I love to work on challenging problems pertaining to (but definitely not limited to) image and video super-resolution, image synthesis using GANs and efficient camera calibration algorithms.
